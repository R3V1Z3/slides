# slides
Simple presentation tool in JavaScript. It's highly experimental and currently designed strictly to work with Markdown documents hosted on GitHub Gist, rendering the documents as presentation slides on a per-line basis (each line of the document will represent a different slide).  

This is the start of a larger presentation project that will be fully customizable through CSS.
